# [Try to Fit in](https://charcoding.github.io/Try-to-Fit-in/)
A game where you try to fit pentaminos into a given grid.
There are 7 levels, each one getting harder than the last.
It gets really hard. Just like in real life.
# How to play
Select a pentamino from either side, use &larr;/A and &rarr;/D to rotate, &uarr;/W to flip
vertically and &darr;/S to flip horizontally, and click the desired square in the grid to place
down the piece.
To remove a placed pentamino from the grid, click on one of its tiles and place it elsewhere
or click "Unselect".
## More controls
- U: Unselect
- Esc/P: Pause/Unpause
- R: Reset board (timer won't reset)
- G: Give up (warns you before actually giving up)
- Right clicking a piece will flip it _diagonally_
